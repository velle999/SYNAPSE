#!/usr/bin/env bash
# i18n_test.sh — a translated string in synfiles must be reachable by a translator.
#
# ⛔ 1. qsTr() IS A TRAP AND IT IS THE FIRST THING CHECKED. Qt's translation
#    path needs someone to call QTranslator::load() and installTranslator()
#    before the QML engine starts. quickshell does neither — there is no
#    installTranslator anywhere in the binary and no way to reach one from QML.
#    So qsTr("Copy") compiles, returns "Copy", and translates nothing, in every
#    language, forever. It reads in a diff exactly like a marked string.
#
# ⚠ 2. A NON-LITERAL ARGUMENT extracts nothing. tools/qml-xgettext.py reads the
#    source, not the running program, so I18n.tr(someVariable) is marked-looking
#    and English.
#
# ⛔ 3. AND THE KEYS BESIDE THE LABELS WERE NOT SWEPT UP. A context-menu row
#    carries the action it runs in `act:` beside its label, and a property row
#    carries the record key the binary emitted in `key:`. Translating either
#    does not make a German file manager — it makes one whose menu items do
#    nothing and whose properties panel stops decoding paths. Same rule as
#    ctlpanel.c's settings keys, asserted rather than trusted.
